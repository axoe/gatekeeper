Gatekeeper is an open source system for managing [secrets] in [AWS Secrets Manager]; providing basic mechanisms for creation, maintenance,
and rotation of secrets.

## To start using Gatekeeper

### Overview

Gatekeeper is built on [cobra] and utilises a structure of commands, arguments & flags. It supports Fully POSIX-compliant flags (including short & long versions)

List secrets in a specific region:

```
gatekeeper ls --region eu-west-2
```

Get the value of a secret:

```

Add a new secret:

```
gatekeeper add --name nameofsecret --region eu-west-2 --description "exampledescription" --value "{\"username\":\"foo\",\"password\":\"bar\"}"
```
